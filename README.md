from gaubongai.agents.orchestrator import OrchestratorAgent
from gaubongai.agents.ml_advisor import MLAdvisorAgent

# Initialize components
data_manager = DataIngestionManager()
ml_advisor = MLAdvisorAgent()
orchestrator = OrchestratorAgent()

# Register agents
orchestrator.register_agent("ml_advisor", ml_advisor)

# Load data
df = data_manager.load_csv("your_data.csv")

# Create and execute a workflow
workflow_config = {
    "steps": [
        {
            "name": "ml_analysis",
            "agent": "ml_advisor",
            "method": "analyze_dataset",
            "parameters": {"df": df}
        }
    ]
}

results = orchestrator.execute_workflow(workflow_config)
```
